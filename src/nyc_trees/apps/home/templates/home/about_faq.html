<h4>What is TreesCount! 2015?</h4>
<p>
    TreesCount! is NYC Parks&rsquo; third decadal inventory to map and assess every street tree on every block in New York City.
</p>


<h4>How do I become a voluntreer?</h4>
<p>
    New volun<b>treer</b> training and data collection has ended, but there are opportunities year
    round to get involved in caring for the urban forest. Check out NYC Parks
    <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship">stewardship page</a>
    to find out more.
</p>

<h4>What parts of the city have been mapped so far?</h4>
<p>
    Data collection in many neighborhoods was completed in 2015. Check out our <a href="{% url "progress_page" %}">progress map</a> to find out which neighborhoods are complete.
</p>

<h4>Can I still volunteer</h4>
<p>
    If you are a trained Independent Mapper, Leafout Workshops will be offered to bring you up to date.
    Please email {{ "TreesCount@parks.nyc.gov"|urlize }} for more information.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not an Independent Mapper, don’t worry – there are still other opportunities to get involved!
    Check out NYC Parks <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship">stewardship page</a>
    to find out how you can help care for our urban forest year-round.
</p>

<h4>When will TreesCount! end?</h4>
<p>
    As with our past censuses in 1995-96 and 2005-06, this data collection effort will take two seasons.
    Our goal is to count the last tree by fall of 2016.
</p>

<h4>When can I view the data?</h4>
<p>
    We are excited to share a preview of the new interactive
    <a href="https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/">NYC Street Tree Map</a> that lets you browse the street trees of
    New York City, mark trees as your favorite, share them with your friends, review species information and
    tree stats, and keep a record of your stewardship activities, so that you can see how much your work affects
    our urban forest! While TreesCount! 2015 is ongoing, not every street tree in the city will display on the map,
    including some trees that you may have mapped. We ask you to use this preview map and share your feedback
    with us before we release it to the public later this year.
