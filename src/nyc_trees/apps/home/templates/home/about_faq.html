<h4>What is TreesCount! 2015?</h4>
<p>
    TreesCount! is NYC Parks&rsquo; initiative to map and assess every street tree on every block in New York City.
<!--

-->
</p>

<!--
<h4>Do I need to know a lot about trees to get involved?</h4>
<p>
    No prior experience is required! We will help you learn everything you need to know to participate.
</p>
-->

<h4>How do I become a voluntreer?</h4>
<p>
    New volun<b>treer</b> training and data collection has ended, but there are opportunities year
    round to get involved in caring for the urban forest. Check out NYC Parks
    <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship%22">stewardship page</a>
    to find out more.
<!--
    Getting involved is easy! To get started, <a href="{% url 'registration_register' %}">register</a> on our
    website and take our brief online training course. Then, RSVP to and attend a training event with NYC Parks
    or one of our Census partner groups to gain hands-on knowledge about how to assess and map street trees.
-->
</p>

<!--
<h4>What happens at a TreesCount! 2015 event?</h4>
<p>
    There are two kinds of events: training and mapping.
</p>
<p>
    Training events are designed to help you apply what you learned in the online training course.
    The first hour of a training event is spent mastering the TreeKIT mapping method and learning to use the Treecorder software.
    After the first hour, you will collect data while mapping in teams. You will also receive a Census Gear Pack, complete with
    a NYC Tree ID guide, that is yours to keep!
</p>
<p>
    Mapping events are intended for volun<b>treers</b> who have already been to a training event.
    No instruction period is included, but staff will be present to help you out if you get stuck.
    When you arrive, you will be paired with another volunteer, check out equipment using your volun<b>treer</b> badge,
    and spend the entire event collecting data and mapping. You can
    also check out a wheel directly from any NYC Parks’ mapping event in order to map on your own!
</p>
-->

<h4>Where can I volunteer to map street trees?</h4>
<p>
    Data collection in many neighborhoods was completed in 2015. If you’re a trained mapper,
    check out our <a href="{% url "progress_page" %}">progress map</a> to find out which neighborhoods are complete, and learn where
    we still need your help!.
</p>
<p>
    Volun<b>treer</b> data collection will begin again in spring of 2016. If you are an experienced
    independent mapper, and are interested in volun<b>treering</b> over the winter, please email
    <a href="mailto:Treescount@parks.nyc.gov">Treescount@parks.nyc.gov</a>
    to find out how.
</p>
<p>
    If you missed voluntreer training for TreesCount! don’t worry – there are still other
    opportunities to get involved! Check out NYC Parks
    <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship%22">stewardship page</a>
    to find out how you can help care for our urban forest year-round.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    We are hosting events in neighborhoods throughout all five boroughs of New York City.
    Many local organizations are contributing to the mapping effort, and you will be able to
    participate in events hosted by TreesCount! partner groups and by NYC Parks.
    After you’ve completed your online training, find training and mapping events near you <a href="{% url "events_list_page" %}">here</a>.

<!--
<h4>Do I need to bring anything to a training event?</h4>
<p>
    Just a love of trees and a willingness to learn! You will need your TreesCount! username and
    password in order to be checked into the event. At the training event, you will receive a
    TreesCount! Gear Pack with a tree species ID guide, measuring tape, volunteer badge and lanyard, and a safety vest.
    These items are for you to keep and reuse for the duration of the census.
    NYC Parks and our partners will provide you with a measuring wheel and a tablet for mapping trees and collecting data,
    and these will be collected at the end of the event.
</p>

<h4>What should I bring to a mapping event?</h4>
<p>
    Please bring all the items in your TreesCount! Gear Pack from the training event &ndash;
    you will need your measuring tape, Tree Species ID guide, safety vest, and volunteer badge and lanyard!
    Please also remember the username and password you created so that you can be checked into the event
    and receive credit on your profile for the blocks and trees you’ve mapped.
</p>

<h4>I want to map trees but can’t always attend a mapping event. Can I map trees on my own?</h4>
<p>
    Yes, after you have attended a training event and one additional event, a button will
    appear on your profile and dashboard. Click the button to activate your independent mapper status, and
    then you will be able to reserve and map blocks on your own.
</p>
<p>
    You can reserve any block edges not claimed by a group. Some TreesCount! Partner Groups also allow
    independent mappers in their zones, so check the Group’s Profile page to find out if they allow
    independent mappers and to request permission to map in their area.
</p>
<p>
    Checking out a wheel is easy!
    You can either visit one of our loaning hubs, or check out a wheel at the end of any NYC Parks’ mapping events.
</p>
<p>
    Wheels are checked out using your volun<b>treer</b> badge and can be checked out for up to one
    week at a time. If you check out a wheel from an NYC Parks mapping event, you can return
    it to any NYC Parks training or mapping event. If you check out a wheel from a loaning hub,
    it should be returned to that loaning hub so that it is available for other mappers!
</p>
<p>
    Get started reserving your block edges <a href="{% url 'reservations' %}">here</a> &ndash; they
    will be reserved for you for seven days before being released back into the pool for another volun<b>treer</b> to claim.
</p>

<h4>What is a loaning hub?</h4>
<p>
    Loaning hubs are locations where independent mappers can check out measuring wheels from NYC Parks and
    TreesCount! Partner Groups for use in mapping on their own.
</p>
<p>
    Wheels are checked out using your volun<b>treer</b> badge and can be loaned out for up to one week at a time.
    Wheels must be returned to the same hub from which they were borrowed.
</p>
<p>
    Please visit the <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/treescount/independent-mapping">NYC&nbsp;Parks&nbsp;website</a> for
    a current list of loaning hubs, and always call the loaning hub contact number to confirm that wheels are available
    before visiting! Loaning hub locations will be updated periodically throughout the summer.
</p>

<h4>When will TreesCount! end?</h4>
<p>
    As with our past censuses in 1995-96 and 2005-06, this data collection effort will take two
    seasons. Volunteers, community groups, and expert staff members are all vital contributors
    to this effort, and working together we can make sure every tree counts!
<!--
    Our goal is to complete data collection this fall, with the end
    date depending on variables such as weather and participation
    rates. Volunteers, community groups and expert staff are all vital
    contributors to this effort.
