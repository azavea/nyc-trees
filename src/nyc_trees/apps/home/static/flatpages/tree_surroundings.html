  <h3>1. Tree Guards</h3>
  <p>Tree guards come in all shapes and sizes. They protect the area around a tree. For a structure
    to count as a tree guard, it must be more than three inches tall and wrap around most of the
    perimeter of the tree or the tree bed. Select <strong>not installed</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em> if a street tree
    does not have a guard. If a tree does have a guard, select <strong>installed</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em> and
    enter whether it is <strong>helpful</strong>, <strong>harmful</strong> or if you are <strong>unsure</strong>.</p>
  <figure>

    <p>Some trees will have <strong>helpful</strong> tree guards installed. Helpful guards wrap around three or four sides of
      the perimeter of the tree bed and can be made of many materials, including metal, wood, plastic, or rope/string. Select <strong>Helpful Guard</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em> if you see any of these types of guards around a tree.

   <img src="/static/img/training/Good-guard-two/good-guard-two.png"/>
 </figure>
<figure>
  <p>Some trees will have <strong>harmful</strong> tree guards installed. A tall and narrow metal guard installed close to
the tree trunk is harmful. Any wall that allows soil to pile up against the trunk of the tree more than
three inches from the ground is harmful. Select <strong>Harmful Guard</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em> if you see any of these types of guards around a tree.

 <img src="/static/img/training/bad-guard-three/bad-guard-three.png"/>
 </figure>

  <p>Some trees will have guards that are both helpful and harmful. If you’re not sure which to choose, select <strong>Unsure</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Why Track Tree Guards?</em></p>
  <p>Tree guards can help protect trees if they are built and installed correctly. Tracking the many types of tree guards found on our streets can help NYC Parks understand how many guards are actually helping or harming street trees .</p>

    <h3>2. Stewardship Practices</h3>
  <p>Evidence of street tree stewardship is measured as the number of different clues we find to
suggest that someone is actively taking care of a tree. Stewardship, or volunteer tree care,
comes in many different forms.</p>
<figure>
  <p>In addition to installing helpful <strong>tree guards</strong>, stewards may spread <strong>mulch</strong> or <strong>woodchips</strong> over a street
tree bed. Mulch helps the soil around the tree hold onto water. It blankets the soil and makes it a warm environment for beneficial plants and animals. It also makes the soil healthy as it breaks down over time.

  </p>
  <img src="/static/img/training/mulch/mulch.png"/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p>Tree stewards may plant <strong>flowers</strong> or other <strong>plants</strong> in a street tree bed. Plants and flowers help keep the
  soil loose and crumbly, letting air and water reach the tree roots down below. They also let other
  people know that the tree is loved and appreciated.
  </p>

  <img src="/static/img/training/Planting-One/planting-one.png"/>
  <img src="/static/img/training/Planting-Two/planting-two.png"/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p>Tree stewards may install <strong>signs</strong> near a street tree in the tree bed. The signs may tell pet owners to curb their dogs away from the tree bed. Signs may also teach the general public about the importance of street trees. Do not count signs taped, nailed, stapled, or drilled into a tree. Do not count signs that have nothing to do with trees, such as no-parking signs or business flyers.
  </p>

  <img src="/static/img/training/SignTwo/Sign-Two.png"/>
  <img src="/static/img/training/SignThree/Sign-Three.png"/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p>Tree stewards may install <strong>decorations</strong> near a street tree. Decorations may include stones, planters, bird boxes or even ceramic garden gnomes and plastic pink flamingos. As long as decorations do not penetrate the bark or restrict tree growth in any way, they help to define a tree’s boundaries and let pedestrians know the tree is important. Decorations show that someone values the tree and its surroundings.
  </p>
  <img src="/static/img/training/Decorations/decoration.png"/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p>Tree stewards may install <strong>seating</strong> near a street tree, such as a small bench or a chair. Seating suggests that someone appreciates sitting in the shade of the tree.
  </p>
  <img src="/static/img/training/seat/seat.png"/>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p>You may find a steward actively taking care of a tree while you are mapping a block edge. Stewards water trees, pull weeds out of tree beds, loosen up soil with rakes and shovels, and pick trash out of tree beds. There is no better evidence of stewardship than seeing it happen right before your eyes!
  </p>
  <img src="/static/img/training/Stewardship/stewardship.png"/>
</figure>

  <p>You may also find other clues that stewardship is happening. Trust your gut. If you see
something that suggests tree care is happening, include it in your count of different kinds of
stewardship activity.</p>

  <p>Count the number of different types of stewardship practices you see: tree guards, mulch,
flowers or plants, signs, decorations, seating, or any active stewardship. In the <em>Treecorder</em>, select the range of different types of stewardship you count: <strong>zero, one to two, three to four</strong>, or <strong>more than four</strong>.</p>

  <p><em>Why Measure Stewardship Practices</em></p>
  <p>Finding evidence of stewardship may help NYC Parks understand where trees are actively
maintained and where trees need more careful attention from volunteers.</p>

    <h3>3. Sidewalk Condition</h3>
    <p>Sidewalks surrounding street trees sometimes need to be repaired. Sidewalk conditions
immediately surrounding the tree bed are tracked in two ways: 1) <strong>no damage is seen</strong>; and 2) <strong>cracks or raised</strong>. Look only at the sidewalk squares immediately touching the outside of the street tree bed.</p>
    
  <figure>
    <p>Sidewalks where <strong>no damage is seen</strong> have no large cracks, though some small and fine cracks may be visible. Sidewalk squares are not lifted in any significant way.
    </p>
    <img src="/static/img/training/sidewalk-fine/sidewalk-fine.png"/>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <p>Sidewalks where <strong>cracks or raising</strong> are seen have large and clearly visible cracks. Sidewalk squares are lifted more than one inch. 
    </p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/Sidewalk-crack/sidewalk-crack.png"/>
    <img src="/static/img/training/side-crack2/side-crack2.png"/>
    <img src="/static/img/training/sidewalk-raised/sidewalk-raised.png"/>
  </figure>

  <p>Observe the condition of the sidewalk squares immediately touching the tree bed. If there is no
damage, select <strong>No Damage</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em>. If you can see damage, select <strong>Cracks or Raised</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Why Track Sidewalk Damage?</em></p>
  <p>NYC Parks can use sidewalk damage data for future maintenance programs. For more
      information about the Trees &amp; Sidewalks program, visit the NYC Parks website.</p>

    <h3>4. Tree Problems</h3>
    <p>Street tree trunks, branches, and roots are sometimes choked by different kinds of objects and infrastructure. Tree problems are tracked in four categories: 1) <strong>no tree problems</strong>; 2) <strong>root problems</strong>; 3) <strong>trunk problems</strong>; and 4) <strong>branch problems</strong>.</p>
    
    <img src="/static/img/training/Tree_Problems.png"/>

    <p>Most trees will have <strong>no problems</strong>. Enter <strong>No Problems</strong> in the <em>Treecorder</em>.</p>

  <figure>
    <p>Some trees will have <strong>root problems</strong>. Root problems happen when roots grow over paving stones, bricks, sidewalk edges, metal grates, or any other hard surface on the ground. Select the type of root problem (<strong>sidewalk or stones, metal grates</strong>, or <strong>other</strong>) you see in the <em>Treecorder</em>.
    </p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/Root-one/root-one.png"/>
    <img src="/static/img/training/Root-two/root-two.png"/>
    <img src="/static/img/training/Root-Three/root-three.png"/>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <p>Some trees will have <strong>trunk problems</strong>. Trunk problems happen when wires, stringed lights, and even tall tree guards restrict the trunk’s growth. Enter the type of trunk problem (<strong>wires or rope, lights</strong>, or <strong>other</strong>) you see in the <em>Treecorder</em>.

    </p>
    <img src="/static/img/training/trunk/Trunk-one/trunk-one.png"/>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <p>Some trees have <strong>branch problems</strong>. Branch problems are often caused by lights, zip ties, or sneakers or shoes tossed into the tree canopy. Select the type of branch problem (<strong>lights, sneakers</strong>, or <strong>other</strong>) you see in the <em>Treecorder</em>.
    </p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/branch-problem/branch-problem.png"/>
  </figure>

  <p><em>Why Track Tree Problems?</em></p>
  <p>NYC Parks can sometimes rescue street trees with root, tree, or branch problems.</p>
