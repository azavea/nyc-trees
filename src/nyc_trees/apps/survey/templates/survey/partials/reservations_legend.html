    Ready to map on your own? If you’re interested in mapping over the winter, please email
    <a href="mailto:Treescount@parks.nyc.gov">Treescount@parks.nyc.gov</a>
    to sign up for a winter data collection course and learn how to
    keep rolling. You can also check back in the spring to find out where we still need your help,
    and reserve more available block edges for mapping.
