As a reward for your interest, we wanted you to be among the first people in New York City with access to our NYC Street Tree Map (https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/). This map lets you browse the street trees of New York City, mark trees as your favorite, share them with your friends, review species information and tree stats, and keep a record of your stewardship activities, so that you can see how much your work affects our urban forest! We ask you to use this map and share your feedback with us. 

If you have questions about the project, please email us at treescount@parks.nyc.gov.

**registration/activation_email.txt**

Used to generate the text body of the activation email. Should display a
link the user can click to activate the account. This template has the
following context:

``activation_key``
    The activation key for the new account.

``expiration_days``
    The number of days remaining during which the account may be
    activated.

``site``
    An object representing the site on which the user registered;
    depending on whether ``django.contrib.sites`` is installed, this
    may be an instance of either ``django.contrib.sites.models.Site``
    (if the sites application is installed) or
    ``django.contrib.sites.models.RequestSite`` (if not). Consult `the
    documentation for the Django sites framework
    <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/>`_ for
    details regarding these objects' interfaces.

``user``
    The new user account

``request``
    ``HttpRequest`` instance for better flexibility.
    For example it can be used to compute absolute register URL:

        http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'registration_activate' activation_key %}

    or when using Django >= 1.7:

        {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'registration_activate' activation_key %}
